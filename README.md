# No-BS KeyChain

An app that is user centric which essentially allows users to properly maange their payments system just with one account setup, no more extra steps or compromising your data while shopping online.

## Overview

This app came from my frustation of always needing to put my debit or credit info on every site I enter and needing to send all my data to a merchant without knowing what the third party auth might do with my data. In this sense this project helps me in the sense that I can protect my data and at the same time have a fast and easy to use 1-click checkout system.
This repo is more a concept art of how this infrastructure might work, since is a hard project to actually complete fully to be a sellable porject. My main objective is to give the seed to might be the future of secure keychains with high privacy in place. Also this is mainly for fun and entretainment while I learn more of coding and creating high-quality projects with proper engineering processes.
